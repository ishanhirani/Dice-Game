# Dice-Game

very own dice game. implementing javascript and DOM

So it's a paint with a h1 with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and

Player 2 dice.

And when we refresh our web site then our dice get thrown randomly,

so that player 1 and player 2

both have their own dice values, and our web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value

was higher.

So you can see that this will be a really neat web site and you can use this web site to settle all

your relationship arguments and any sort of disputes just by logging on to your own web site and trying to

figure out who won.
